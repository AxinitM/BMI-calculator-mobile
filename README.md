## BMI Calculator Description

The page features a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator that allows users to calculate their BMI based on the height and weight they input. BMI is a measure used to estimate a person's weight in relation to their height and categorize their condition as underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese. 
After calculating, the user receives their BMI value along with a brief explanation. Depending on the result, both the background color and the explanatory text change accordingly.
